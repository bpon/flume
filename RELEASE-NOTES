1. What is Apache Flume
Flume is a distributed, reliable, and available service for
efficiently collecting, aggregating, and moving large amounts of log
data. It has a simple and flexible architecture based on streaming
data flows. It is robust and fault tolerant with tunable reliability
mechanisms and many failover and recovery mechanisms. The system is
centrally managed and allows for intelligent dynamic management. It
uses a simple extensible data model that allows for online analytic
application.

2. Status of this release
This release of Apache Flume is the first release within the Apache
Incubator, and is labelled and should be considered as an alpha version.
This means that we do not guarantee any stability, that API and features
are still likely to change until a final release version.
This is a 'source-only' release, which means no binary artifacts will
be distributed as part of the release.

3. Major changes in this Release
This section describes the changes between Flume 0.9.x and this version.
This new codebase of Flume (aka Flume-NG) is refactoring of the first
generation Flume to solve certain known issues and limitations of the
original design. It's not backward compatible with previous
Flume versions (0.9.x) in terms of the configuration as well as plugings.
